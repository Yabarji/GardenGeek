Use cairo to produce a view of the garden, week by week.
 - will help visualize how much space there is for new plants when old ones are
   harvested.

Use simple math to produce a calendar of what should be seeded indoors,
separated indoors, seeded outdoors, transplanted, separated outdoors, and
harvested, and when that should happen.

Ideal output:

Month and week

 ---------------
|plot of plants |
|growing indoors|
 ---------------

 -----------------
|plot(s) of plants|
|growing outdoors |
 -----------------

Important dates this month:
To seed indoors:
 3/1 - tomatoes - 6 seeds

To separate into bigger pots indoors:
 3/14 - tomatoes

To transplant:
 3/30 - tomatoes - 4 plants

google calendar would send reminders for *actions*, i.e. seed, separate,
transplant, harvest.


Start simple:
 - assume I will be gardening during the mid-april through mid-august, where the
   doubling rate is constant.
 - assume all plants double in size at the same rate.  Given infinite growing
   space and time, they would continue to grow.  Ignore winter's growth slack
   off.
 - don't take into account "tallness".  Some plants would rather grow upwards
   than outwards.  Model that as a limit on the horizontal size.
 - assume only one plot.

Questions:
 - what is the growth rate under a grow lamp?  Will be constant.  Greater than
   rate during early spring, but less than rate around, say, mid-april.  Maybe
   say it's 15 days?
