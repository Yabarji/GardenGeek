Use cairo to produce a view of the garden, week by week.
 - will help visualize how much space there is for new plants when old ones are
   harvested.

Use simple math to produce a calendar of what should be seeded indoors,
separated indoors, seeded outdoors, transplanted, separated outdoors, and
harvested, and when that should happen.

Ideal output:

Month and week

 ---------------
|plot of plants |
|growing indoors|
 ---------------

 -----------------
|plot(s) of plants|
|growing outdoors |
 -----------------

Important dates this month:
To seed indoors:
 3/1 - tomatoes - 6 seeds

To separate into bigger pots indoors:
 3/14 - tomatoes

To transplant:
 3/30 - tomatoes - 4 plants

google calendar would send reminders for *actions*, i.e. seed, separate,
transplant, harvest.

ical format thoughts:
 - Need a time zone section - use PDT for now, ask user later
 - descriptions need to be sanitized - ical can't handle commas, for example.
 - dates are in YMD'T'HMS format


Start simple:
 - assume I will be gardening during the mid-april through mid-august, where the
   doubling rate is constant.
 - assume all plants double in size at the same rate.  Given infinite growing
   space and time, they would continue to grow.  Ignore winter's growth slack
   off.
 - don't take into account "tallness".  Some plants would rather grow upwards
   than outwards.  Model that as a limit on the horizontal size.
 - assume only one plot.

Questions:
 - what is the growth rate under a grow lamp?  Will be constant.  Greater than
   rate during early spring, but less than rate around, say, mid-april.  Maybe
   say it's 15 days?

Soil temperature monitoring
---------------------------

Use agricultural gov. data to get current soil temperature.
http://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/dayfiles/araoday.txt
Aurora is 20 miles south of Portland.  ZA is the soil temperature 2" down.
http://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/wxdata.html

Goals:
 - Monitor temperature, send SMS/twitter message when it's time to plant
   specific seeds.


Frost warnings
--------------
 - Send SMS/email/twitter the night before a frost (when low is less than 34
   degrees F).
