There are a few files in this project that do not fall under the GPL:
 - doubling-rates.png
 - light-level-and-growth-rates.png
 - veggie_calendar.pdf

The first two picture files are taken from the google books preview of Steven
Solomon's book "Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades".  I own the book, and I
highly recommend you buy it too.

The vegetable calendar is taken from the Portland Nursery website:

They update it from time to time, so it is worth grabbing the latest calendar
(especially with the climate change caused by global warming).

If these files are still here when the project is released, it means I haven't
done my job of scrubbing the project of files that I'm not allowed to
distribute.  Drop me an email <sarah@thesharps.us> and remind me of my licensing
obligations.  If you've dug this out of the git history, good for you.
